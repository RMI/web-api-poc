Set up initial folder structure and root endpoint for API that returns "Hello World". Used UV for environment management. First router is a "health" endpoint that returns http status "OK", used health router to set up models and routers folders, defining the health model and router respectively. Mostly smooth sailing so far. Watched Youtube tutorials for UV and FastAPI, both have been intuitive and well-documented.
